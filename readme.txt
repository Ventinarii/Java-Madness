it goes like this:
Factorio lite => my very early II SEM (and optimistic attmept at recreating factorio) - FAIL \ map clustereing & render atmepts - that works, sometimes.
Games         => my 2nd attmept, again II SEM - remake of warblades game, back then i had no idea how to make AI so it is PvP
SKJ 1.2 - 4.1 => expereimtns with networking in java, III SEM, decentralized game that is (rather) not posible to cheat from one machine - you need to own at least over half of all of them in practise each machine is not having 0 trust policy towards all others.
++ this ^ thing is having dynamic adress tables - having fun with attempt to remake DNS
Life          => having some fun with celluar automata IV SEM
